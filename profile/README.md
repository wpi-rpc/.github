# Welcome to the WPI Robotics Prototyping Club! (RPC)

We're a group of students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Massachusetts, that put our maker skills towards specialized robotics projects! All in the name of fostering a community around clean hobbyist robotics done right. 

## What exactly is RPC?
### The BIG Idea:
The Robotics Prototyping Clube (RPC) is a WPI student club recently founded during the Fall of 2024. RPC aims to support formal undergraduate-led experimentation and development on club-approved projects related to robotics engineering, including but not limited to training core robotics skills and participating in design challenges and other related events. 
### A Deeper Look:
Most importantly, RPC serves as a platform for extracurricular exploration in robotics, fostering networking, hobby projects, and professional collaborations between club members and the faculty of the WPI Robotics Engineering Department. RPC will provide a low barrier of entry for those new to robotics, while also helping experienced roboticists prototype advanced ideas and further elevate their skills. 

**Overall, RPC seeks to promote an environment where hobby robotics projects are taken seriously, and thus prepare members for future opportunities, be they internships, graduate studies, or professional lab work.** 

## What is the XRP?

The Experential Robotics Platform (XRP) is an open-robotics platform designed to help you take your first steps into engineering, robotics, and software development. The XRP is not only simple, inexpensive, and easy to build, but includes access to a free open curriculum developed by Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) through its OpenSTEM platformâ€”guiding even the novice user. 

## RPC with XRP:

Along with supporting various student-run hobbyist robotics projects, RPC intends to use XRP as a medium to also further explore robotics. Whether it be in club events or XRP-robot based projects.
